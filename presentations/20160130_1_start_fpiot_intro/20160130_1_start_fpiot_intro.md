# What's Functional IoT?

* http://fpiot.metasepi.org/
* is a wrestling mat that strong typed languages fight on, to become the champion of system programming language.
* tries to write demo code running on MCU using the languages.
* summarizes knowledge of the languages as catalog.

# Why do Functional IoT?

* Today, we have many methodologies for system design.
* They are static typing, theorem proving, formal method, design by contract, model checking, static verification, SMT solver, etc.
* However, nobody have the exhaustive catalog of them.
* Let's make the catalog!

# Why need such language?

Many people choose C/C++ languages to design IoT device.
However the languages lack following:

* Avoiding vulnerability
* Soundness
* Specification to be verified
* Calculated man-hour
* Keeping quality

# Avoiding vulnerability

# Specification to be verified
