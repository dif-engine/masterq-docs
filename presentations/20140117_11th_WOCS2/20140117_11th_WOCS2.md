# Agenda

* [1] Problems of OS using C
* [2] Type safety
* [3] Existing OS using strong type
* [4] Snatch-driven development
* [5] Demo
* [6] Case study of Snatch
* [7] It's not yet done

# [1] Problems of OS using C

* Most OS uses C language
* C is good for system programming
* But C occurs many problems

# Buffer overrun

* Pointer to array doesn't know the length

# Page fault in kernel

* Page fault in user space => SEGV
* Page fault in kernel space => Halt!

# Weak type

* Great use of (void *) type
* NetBSD kernel uses 45130 times!

~~~
$ pwd
/home/kiwamu/src/netbsd/sys
$ grep "void \*" `find . -name "*.c"` | wc -l
45130

* No choice but to use weak type for flexibility

# [2] Type safety

* Get less runtime errors

# Avoid buffer overrun

Strong type avoids buffer overrun.

# Avoid page fault in kernel

Strong type avoids it also.


# Flexibility without weak type

# Totally, kernel needs strong type

# [3] Existing OS using strong type

Alreadly we have.

Why isn't it for daily use?

# Poor design and less functions

* Design from scratch
* Polling interrupt
* Not have bus driver
* Support less devices
* Only for x86
* Can't run Firefox

# No compatible POSIX

# [4] Snatch-driven development

# UNIX like OS needs reentrant

# Ajhc Haskell compiler
