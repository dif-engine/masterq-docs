* NetBSD audio driver play sound
* The driver's interrupt handler rewrited using Haskell
* GC occurs in interrupt handler
* Watch the movie at following

* Unix-like OS designed by strong type.
* Using ML or more strong type lang.

Haskell http://www.haskell.org/

OCaml http://caml.inria.fr/

MLton http://mlton.org/

. . . and suchlike.

# Scratch or Rewrite
# Snatch-driven development
# Compiler for system programing
# Need preemptive multitasking

* There are 2 way for multitasking
* [A] Nonpreemptive multitasking
* [B] Preemptive multitasking
* Unix-like OS needs [B]
* [B] needs the hardware interrupts
* Interrupt handler should be reentrant

# What's reentrancy ?
# How to get reentrancy in C ?
# C language Context
# Problem: Interrupt and GC

# There is Haskell Context ?
# When Haskell Context is born ?
# What's Haskell Context ?
# Implementation: CLHs
# Haskell Context (CLHs)
# Haskell Context life cycle (CLHs)

~~~
(O)  Original NetBSD 6.1.2 kernel
(S)  The kernel includes AC'97 and HD Audio driver snatched by Ajhc
(N)  (S) + using naive GC
(B4) (S) + having GC block 16 Byte
(B5) (S) + having GC block 32 Byte
(B6) (S) + having GC block 64 Byte
