# Writing NetBSD Sound Drivers in Haskell

My name is Kiwamu Okabe.
I'm a Self employed software engineer at METASEPI DESIGN.
Today, I talk about kernel programming in Haskell.

and focus our Reentrant GC for real kernel programming.

# Demo: NetBSD driver in Haskell

The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Let's see the demo!
