# Writing NetBSD Sound Drivers in Haskell

Hi all.
My name is Kiwamu Okabe.
I'm a Self employed software engineer at METASEPI DESIGN.
Today, I talk about kernel programming in Haskell.
However, I don't touch detail of kernel programming,
and focus our Reentrant GC for real kernel programming.

# Demo: NetBSD driver in Haskell

The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Let's see the demo!

# Demo architecture
# Kernel developers want type
# Kernel Bug #1: Buffer overrun
# Kernel Bug #2: Page fault
# Kernel Bug #3: Weak type
# Metasepi Project
# Scratch or Rewrite
# Snatch-driven development #1
# Snatch-driven development #2
# Why we use jhc ?
# Unix-like OS needs reentrancy
# What's reentrancy ?
# How do we get reentrancy in C ?
# What's C language Context ?
# Problem: Interrupt and GC
# Root of the problem
# How we can fix this problem
# Context-Local Heaps (CLHs)
# What's Haskell Context on CLHs?
# Haskell Context life cycle (CLHs)
# Isolated contexts are reentrant?
