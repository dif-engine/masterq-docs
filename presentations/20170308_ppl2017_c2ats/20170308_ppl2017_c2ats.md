# Generate ATS interface from C code, and introduce linear type

Kiwamu Okabe @ RIKEN AICS

# Today's low level programming
# Why need the other language?
# ATS language
# Problem on ATS programming
# A tool named "c2ats" resolves it!
# But, building c2ats is not easy
# Rule: Translating primitive types
# Rule: Functions
# Rule: Enum
# Rule: Struct
# Rule: Pointers and at-view
# Rule: Accessor for pointer members
# Rule: Accessor for global variables
# Example: C header
# Example: Generated ATS interfaces
# Dangerous ATS application on the API
# Manually introduce linear type
# Conclusion
