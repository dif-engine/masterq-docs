# What's VeriFast?

* https://github.com/verifast/verifast
* A verifier for single-threaded and multi-threaded C and Java language programs annotated with preconditions and postconditions written in separation logic.
* VeriFast avoids illegal memory accesses such like buffer overflow.
* VeriFast is easy to use with the graphical IDE.

# VeriFasts find bugs on Linux kernel

"Verification of Linux's USB Boot Protocol Keyboard Driver (usbkbd)"
https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~willem.penninckx/usbkbd/

This project verified Linux's USB Boot Protocol Keyboard Driver (usbkbd), shipped with the Linux kernel. As far as we know, prior to this work, no device driver verification has been carried out that successfully combines:

* verifying software not written with verification in mind, and
* using a sound approach (we don't "try to find bugs", but "prove absence of bugs"), and
* not avoiding concurrency (concurrency is common in this driver, and we do prove absence of race conditions), and
* not relying on any bounding (there's an unbounded number of threads, unbounded number of keyboards, unbounded amount of time the driver is running, ...)
```

# How to use VeriFast?

* Manually write pre/postcondition as comments in C language code.
* VeriFast statically verifies such assertion.
* You may understand this style of verification as "static design by contract".

# ChibiOS/RT RTOS

* http://www.chibios.org/
* Simple / Small / Fast / Portable real-time OS
* Run on ARM Cortex-M / 8-bit AVR / PowerPC e200
* Context Switch (STM32F4xx): 0.40 Âµsec
* Kernel Size (STM32F4xx): 6172 byte

# Verification platform for RTOS

# Limitation of VeriFast today

* It needs two C language header.
* Original C headers are for compiling C code.
* Pseud C headers are for verifying C code.
* They may have some semantic gap, which cause miss verification.

# We need C99 compatible VeriFast!

* If VeriFast supports C99, we can directly inject assertion onto original C headers.
* No more pseud C headers.
* Linux kernel quality is shaped by human review, today.
* If there is C99 compat VeriFast, we keep such quality things with verification!

# Next action: survey Clang parser

* Is following good for the first step?
* "Clang UPC2C Translator"
* https://clangupc.github.io/clang-upc2c/
* It translates UPC (Unified Parallel C) code into C language code.
* After survey, we will replace VeriFast C language parser with Clang's.

# AD: C92 Functional Ikamusume book

We will publish VeriFast tutorial translated into Japanese, and more.
