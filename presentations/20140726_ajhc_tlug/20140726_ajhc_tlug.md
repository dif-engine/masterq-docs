# [2] What's Metasepi?

![background](img/metasepi.png)

http://metasepi.org/

* Unix-like OS designed by strong type.
* Using ML or more strong type lang.

Haskell http://www.haskell.org/

OCaml http://caml.inria.fr/

MLton http://mlton.org/

. . . and suchlike.

# Why need Metasepi?
![background](img/obsolete_cds.png)

* We have already Linux or Windows.
* But the developers are suffering.
* If use the kernel changed by you,
* you will get many runtime error.
* Difficult even to reproduce it.

# Doesn't OSS have good quality?

* Error on kernel space => Halt!
* Should design kernel with the greatest care.

Should we use safer language than C?

# [3] What's Ajhc compiler?
![background](img/ajhc.png)

http://ajhc.metasepi.org/

* Ajhc := Arafura designed jhc
* jhc := John's Haskell Compiler
* http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/
* Jhc outputs binary that has low-memory-footprint and runs fast.

# Who is John?
![background](img/john.png)

* John Meacham
* http://repetae.net/

# Why choose jhc?
![background](img/robin_milner.png)

Programs to print "hoge" on terminal. The lesser depends on POSIX, the smaller values.

# Jhc is translator to C language

# [4] Reentrancy and Context
![background](img/re-entry.png)

* Metasepi needs language implementation supporting reentrancy.
* Why?

# Why need Reentrancy?
![background](img/block_diagram.png)

* There are 2 way for multitasking
* [A] Nonpreemptive multitasking
* [B] Preemptive multitasking
* Unix-like OS needs [B]
* [B] needs the hardware interrupts
* Interrupt handler should be reentrant

# What's Reentrancy?
![background](img/whirlpool.png)

~~~
Reentrant code can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution.
~~~

![inline](draw/reentrant.png)

# What's Context on C language?
![background](img/worlds_stacking.png)

* A set of registers and call stacks

![inline](draw/context.png)

# Where Context come from?
![background](img/jumping_sunset.png)

![inline](draw/context_comefrom.png)

# What's Context switch?
![background](img/shutter_release_switch.png)

~~~
The process of storing and restoring the state (context) of a process or thread so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time.

Hi Metasepi-chan,

I spent quite some time today browsing metasepi.org.

I am really interested in your Metasepi project, partly because I myself wanted to implement NetBSD in ATS about 5 years ago. Unfortunately, I never had time to get the project started as I needed to spend so much time on ATS2. By the way, I had planned to use the very same approach which you call "Snatch". I had also considered Minix but I chose NetBSD because it was a real OS.

I think I know first-handedly the dilemma you are currently in. On one hand, you want to be able to fully focus on writing the kernel. On the other hand, you also need to add features to Ajhc constantly to address all kinds of issues that keep popping up, which undoubtedly makes it very difficult for you to focus.
~~~

# Hongwei said... (cont.)

~~~
I would highly recommend that you use ATS to implement NetBSD kernel. Unlike jhc, there is no semantics gap between ATS and C. In particular, they both use the same native unboxed data representation. Once you become familiar with ATS, you can readily visualize the C code that your ATS source is to be compiled into. ATS is truly an ideal language for the kind of "Snatch" approach you want to take to re-write NetBSD. If you take the lead, then I will be happy to "chip in" :)

I also spent some time reading documentation on jhc. Personally, I feel that there is simply too much uncertainty to use it in real kernel implementation. Features like GC could make the kernel highly unpredictable, scaring away potential users.

I think that we both believe C is the right language for systems programming. The problem with C is that it is too difficult to write correct C programs. ATS is designed to allow the programmer to correctly write the kind of C programs he or she wanted to write in the first place. While jhc generates C code, the kind of C code it generates may not be suited for kernel. This is what I call a semantics gap.
~~~

I write this message in the hope that we could join effort in doing something that has not been done up to now: Writing a real kernel in (largely) functional style that can truly deliever safety-wise as well as performance-wise.

Cheers,

--Hongwei
