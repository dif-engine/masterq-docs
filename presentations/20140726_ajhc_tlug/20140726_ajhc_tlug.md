# Agenda

* [1] Demo: NetBSD driver in Haskell
* [2] What's Metasepi?
* [3] What's Ajhc compiler?
* [4] Reentrancy and Context
* [5] Context Local Heap (CLHs)
* [6] How to write Haskell driver?
* [7] What's coming next?

# [2] What's Metasepi?

![background](img/metasepi.png)

http://metasepi.org/

* Unix-like OS designed by strong type.
* Using ML or more strong type lang.

Haskell http://www.haskell.org/

OCaml http://caml.inria.fr/

MLton http://mlton.org/

. . . and suchlike.

# Why need Metasepi?
![background](img/obsolete_cds.png)

* We have already Linux or Windows.
* But the developers are suffering.
* If use the kernel changed by you,
* you will get many runtime error.
* Difficult even to reproduce it.

# Doesn't OSS have good quality?
![background](img/bazaar.png)

* "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
* "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

~~~
http://cruel.org/freeware/cathedral.html
~~~

* But if you develop your own product re-using OSS...

# Low quality out of OSS umbrella

![inline](draw/oss_quality.png)

# Type safety
![background](img/shield.png)

* Less runtime errors.

# Kernel wants type desperately
![background](img/world_without_trees.png)

* Kernels are developed with C lang.
* Error on user space => SEGV
* Error on kernel space => Halt!
* Should design kernel with the greatest care.
* C language is safe?

# Remember Heartbleed bug?
![background](img/heartbleed.png)

Should we use safer language than C?

"A safer systems programming language could have prevented the bug."

# [3] What's Ajhc compiler?
![background](img/ajhc.png)

http://ajhc.metasepi.org/

* Ajhc := Arafura designed jhc
* jhc := John's Haskell Compiler
* http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/
* Jhc outputs binary that has low-memory-footprint and runs fast.

# Who is John?
![background](img/john.png)

* John Meacham
* http://repetae.net/

# Why choose jhc?
![background](img/robin_milner.png)

Programs to print "hoge" on terminal. The lesser depends on POSIX, the smaller values.

![inline](img/compiler_list.png)

# Jhc is translator to C language
![background](img/pdp11.png)

![inline](draw/2012-12-22-jhc_compile.png)

# [4] Reentrancy and Context
![background](img/re-entry.png)

* Metasepi needs language implementation supporting reentrancy.
* Why?

# Why need Reentrancy?
![background](img/block_diagram.png)

* There are 2 way for multitasking
* [A] Nonpreemptive multitasking
* [B] Preemptive multitasking
* Unix-like OS needs [B]
* [B] needs the hardware interrupts
* Interrupt handler should be reentrant

# What's Reentrancy?
![background](img/whirlpool.png)

~~~
Reentrant code can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution.
~~~

![inline](draw/reentrant.png)

# What's Context on C language?
![background](img/worlds_stacking.png)

* A set of registers and call stacks

![inline](draw/context.png)

# Where Context come from?
![background](img/jumping_sunset.png)

![inline](draw/context_comefrom.png)

# What's Context switch?
![background](img/shutter_release_switch.png)

~~~
The process of storing and restoring the state (context) of a process or thread so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time.
~~~

# Support reentrancy with GC
![background](img/re-entry_72c.png)

* Metasepi uses strongly typed language
* Strongly typed language sometimes needs GC
* Most languages doesn't support reentrancy with GC
* How to support reentrancy with GC?

# Problem: Interrupt and GC
![background](img/supernova.png)

![inline](draw/switch_ongc.png)

# [5] Context Local Heap (CLHs)
![background](img/great_wall_china.png)

* Idea: Isolate contexts by local heap

![inline](draw/heapstyle.png)

# Let's define "Haskell Context"

# [6] How to write Haskell driver?
![background](img/snatcher_randam.png)

* Language: Ajhc Haskell compiler
* Base code: NetBSD kernel
* Method: Snatch-driven development

(O)  Original NetBSD 6.1.2 kernel
(S)  The kernel includes AC'97 and HD Audio driver snatched by Ajhc
(N)  (S) + using naive GC

# [7] What's coming next?

![inline](draw/iterative.png)

# What's ATS language?
![background](img/ats_hongwei.png)

http://www.ats-lang.org/

* Syntax like ML
* Dependent types
* Linear types
* Without any runtime
* Optional GC

Good for system programming.
