# [4] Reentrancy and Context

* 2 way for multitasking
* [A] Nonpreemptive multitasking
* [B] Preemptive multitasking
* Unix-like OS needs [B]
* [B] needs the hardware interrupts
* Interrupt handler should be reentrant

# What's Reentrancy?

~~~
Reentrant code can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution.

# What's Context on C language?

* A set of registers and call stack

![inline](draw/context.png)

# Where Context come from?

# What's Context switch?

~~~
The process of storing and restoring the state (context) of a process or thread so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time.
