# What is Infer?

* http://fbinfer.com/
* Based on Separation logic.
* A static analysis tool that produces a list of potential bugs on Objective-C, Java, or C code.
* Such bugs are dereference null pointer, memory leaks and resource leaks.

# What can't Infer find?

* http://fbinfer.com/docs/limitations.html
* Array bounds errors
* Cast exceptions
* Leaking of tainted data
* Concurrency race conditions
* Arithmetic

# Infer has own model

xxx Add figure to explain compiler and Infer

# False positive/negative

* Infer doesn't correctly find bugs.
* False positive: find trouble-free issue as bug.
* False negative: doesn't find trouble issue as bug.
* Infer may cause both false positive and negative.

# How to use Infer?

* Analyze a single C file:

```
$ infer -- gcc -c foo.c
```

* Analyze many C files with GNU make:

```
$ infer -- make
```

* For more detail, please read following:

# What result does Infer show?
# What is design by contract (DbC)?
# Imagine to do DbC at compile-time
# Let's capture invariant using DbC
# But it's not easy...

# How about Coverity?
