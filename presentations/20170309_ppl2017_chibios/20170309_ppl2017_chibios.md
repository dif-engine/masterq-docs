# Comparing ATS and VeriFast on RTOS system state

Kiwamu Okabe @ RIKEN AICS

# Real-time OS: ChibiOS/RT
# System state in ChibiOS/RT
# Class of system API in ChibiOS/RT
# Example: chSysLock()
# Example: chVTSetI()
# Using system API in C
# Undefined behavior by wrong calling!
# Want to avoid it at compile-time...

# ATS language can do that!
# ATS programing on ChibiOS/RT
# Define linear type for system state
# Import system API from C
# Using system API in ATS
# If you call wrong system API...
# ATS finds the error at compile-time!

# Also VeriFast can do that!
